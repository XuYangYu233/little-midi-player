# 一个写着玩的小程序/A small program written for fun

可以以钢琴的音色播放部分midi，但目前还有部分功能上的缺陷/It can play some midi in voices of piano, but it's unfinished yet.

运行方法是点击Midi_play窗口.py，然后选中midi并点击播放就行了/You can execute it by tapping Midi_play_window.py, and choose the midi and tap the button PLAY and it will start to play.

运行时CPU占用率有些大，建议在运行时关掉不必要的进程/It costs a lot on CPU while playing, you'd better kill unneccessary process before playing.

目前先写这么多，有时间了再把这个文档补全/Too lazy to write too much, I will complete this if I have time.
